  - Python: python.org
  - Tesseract OCR: UB Mannheim
  - Visual C++ Redistributable: Microsoft
- **Version Control**: All dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- **Integrity Checks**: SHA-256 checksums available upon request

### 3. Network Security
- **No Network Calls**: Application does not make any network calls
- **Offline Capable**: Can operate completely offline
- **No Telemetry**: No usage data collection or reporting

### 4. System Access
- **Minimal Permissions**: Requires only:
  - Read access to selected files
  - Write access to output directory
  - Temporary file creation
